        <h2>Model UN</h2>
        <p>
          Model UN constitute a big part of my life. It started in the pandemic
          when my friend invited to my first MUN conference. I remember how shy,
          ineloquant & hesitant I was. Yet, the idea of representing a country
          and speaking on behalf of a whole nation somehow impressioned me.
          Thus, I attended more and more MUN conferences online during the
          pandemic. Each conference brought new people, new ideas, and new
          perspectives for me. The more I participated in simulations, the more
          I became self-confident in my speeches, the more I learned how to
          convince my fellow delegates, the better I wrote positions and
          resolutions papers and the more awards I started to win. As the
          pandemic was ending, I wanted to make sure that my story with MUN
          would not end. I gathered a team of 7 persons who participated in
          previous MUN conferences and we founded the first MUN club in our
          region: TIMUN Ezzahra.While more than 100 participants were waiting
          for my speech during the opening ceremony of our grand simulation held
          this summer, I realized how much MUN changed me. It did not just teach
          me how to tie a tie, it helped me develop as a leader and as a person.
          It opened my eyes to the global problems our world is facing: the
          unethical use of technology, the environmental threats the earth is
          suffering from, and the devastating consequences of wars. I know more
          about the threat of a nuclear attack than any eighteen-year-old should
          know. On the other hand, it taught me to change the way I look at
          these problems and always look for solutions. It helped me shape our
          club the way MUN shaped me; as a leader who is motivated to create a
          positive change.
